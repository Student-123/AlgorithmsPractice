Git tagging
---------------
Tagging vs Branching
	We can think of tagging as baselines. It will point to specific commit.
	We can create tags in two ways. It is better to create annotated tags.
	Tags can be created in such a way that, they can point to earlier commits.

	Branching is for linear development. It will be a seperate line for development.
	Later we can merge if we need.
